Class to create objects in database

class Flight(models.Model)
  # Attributes of the class here
  origin = models.CharField(max_length=64)
  ...

Foreign Keys
  origin = models.ForeignKey(Airport, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="departures")
    related_name establishes relationship to find reverse from foreign key
    Given an airport, you can find all flights with that airport as origin

Access Related Name Attribute
  The related_name is an 'attribute' of the foreign key, not the original object
  <foreign_key_object>.<related_name>.all()  <--- can be first(), last() etc

Filter list of objects
  returns object meeting kwarg condition
  <model_name>.objects.filter(kwarg="")

Get First (or only) object from filter list:
  <model_name>.objects.filter(kwarg="").first()

If you know only one result:
  <model_name>.objects.get(kwarg="")

Add Instances of Models from Shell:
  root directory
  python manage.py shell
  from flights.models import *
  jfk = Airport(code="JFK", city="New York")
  jfk.save()
