Pass variables from view into template to render:

def index(request):
  now = datetime.datetime.now()
  return render(request, "newyear/index.html", {
    "newyear": now.month == 1 and now.day == 1
  })

** Here we are passing the bool variable "newyear" into the template index.html
  the { "variablename": value} is a key value pair to pass the value whenever the key is used in the template
