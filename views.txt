Pass variables from view into template to render:

  def index(request):
    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    return render(request, "newyear/index.html", {
      "newyear": now.month == 1 and now.day == 1
    })

  ** Here we are passing the bool variable "newyear" into the template index.html
    the { "variablename": value} is a key value pair to pass the value whenever the key is used in the template
