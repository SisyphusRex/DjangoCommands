Allow different users to access unique data to that user.
Rather than keeping list tasks outside of routes in views.py, put inside route function:

def index(request):
  if "tasks" not in request.session:
    request.session["tasks"] = []
and replace all references to "tasks" list with request.session["tasks"]
