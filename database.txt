1. Create your model class in models.py (create migration instructions)
2. Make django migration instructions
  python manage.py makemigrations
  New file is added to <appname>/migrations/  that contains instructions to django
3. Apply migration to database
  python manage.py migrate

You can run python commands on new database through django shell:
  python manage.py shell
  from <app_name>.models import <Class_name>
  f = <Class_name>(kwargs) <--- creates an instance of the class with kwargs filled in
  f.save()  <--- saves new object/entry to db
  <Class_name>.objects.all()  <--- returns all entries in db, should change Class __str__ function
